Design Decisions:
I used the pseudocode and didn't make too many design choices myself. That being said, at least my printDictionary take in any amount of
lower/uper case letters, and the order part is optional. I also made the VAL_UNDEF NULL, which is a really bad idea because NULL is a common 
thing to enter.


Usuage:
./Order "infile" "outfile" 
infile is a text file to be added line by line to a Red Black tree. Outfile is a pre, post, and inorder traversal of the tree.
