# Red Black Tree Dictionary

## C
There isn't much to say about this project other than it was so very hard trying to understand the inner workings of a RB-Tree. 
Once I had a decent understanding of how it worked, there weren't too many issues. RB-Trees are a good way of storing any type
without too much worry over what type it is, and they only need an equality operation to function. Pretty cool!


## C++
A C++ version of the Red Black tree I made in C for my Data structures class.
I wanted to make the data structure in C++ because of templates mostly. 
In the C version, a #define dictates the type of data the tree holds. 
This is silly for a lot of reasons. C++ has templates, which are nice, but come with their own set of problems.
The worst problem was the cryptic errors the compiler gives when compiling templates with problems in them. 
Working through the problems was frustrating, but instructive.
